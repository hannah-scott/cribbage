# cribbage

A cribbage score-tracker, designed for KaiOS first.

## Use

You can start using `cribbage` from a browser at [cribbage.hd-dn.com](https://cribbage.hd-dn.com). On a smartphone or desktop there are buttons to perform all the actions. Feature phones with arrow keys and desktops also have to the following commands:

| Keybinding   | Action                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `ArrowUp`    | Add score to active player     |
| `ArrowDown`  | Remove score for active player |
| `ArrowLeft`  | Swap to left player            |
| `ArrowRight` | Swap to right player           |

## Installation

You can install `cribbage` by cloning the repository and sideloading it to your KaiOS device.

If you haven't done so before I recommend following [Martin Kaptein's guide to sideloading apps](https://kaptein.me/blog/sideloading-and-deploying-apps-to-kai-os/). You can also use [gdeploy](https://gitlab.com/suborg/gdeploy/), a CLI application manager for KaiOS devices.

## Thanks
